## Description
CA05A:
Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) kills more people than cancer globally. A dataset of real heart patients
collected from a 15 year heart study cohort is made available for this assignment. The dataset has 16
patient features. Note that none of the features include any Blood Test information.
* Part 1: Build a binary classifier model to predict the CVD Risk (Yes/No, or 1/0) using a Logistic
Regression Model with the best performance possible.
* Part 2: Display the Feature Importance of all the features sorted in the order of decreasing influence on
the CVD.
* Part 3: Evaluate the performance of your model (including ROC Curve), explain the performance and
draw a meaningful conclusion.
* Data File Name: cvd_data.csv
